### Program Architecture

First, <code>main.cc</code> uses a *FileReader* to build a *StateFactory*. The latest allows concise creation of *State* objects which contain  *StateTransition* objects that store the transition info. Both *SymbolStack* and *LoadingBelt* are used by Automata to recognize the input word with an algorithm that keeps a state history stack and takes advantage of each state's capability to remember it's applied transitions.
